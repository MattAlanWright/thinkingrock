I'm a software developer with an ultrasound technology firm in Halifax, NS. I work mostly with C, C++ and Python on projects ranging from embedded firmware to ultrasound imaging system UIs. I have my bachelor of engineering in electrical and computer engineering and recently completed my masters of computer science, where I studied machine learning in general and genetic programming in particular.
